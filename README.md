2. writing and compiling a c program

~~~c
#include<stdio.h>

int main()
{
int i,sum=0,n=15;
for (i=1;i<=n;++i)
{
sum=sum+i;
}
printf("sum of numbers from i to %d is %d /n ",n,sum);
}

let's write a c program that shows max and min length of an unsigned
64 bit integer
~~~
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

int main(){
	unsigned long long int max = (unsigned long long int) (pow(2,64) -1);
	unsigned long long int min = (unsigned long long int) (pow(2,64) *(-1));
	printf("lowest number represented by unsigned 64-bit integer is %llu\n",min);

<summary> ABI INTERFACE </summary>

## Application binary interface
ABI is a set of rules that tell us how binary code interacts with another binary code. 64 bit value can be loaded into the memory by 2 methods - little-endian and big-endian. Load instruction is used to transfer data from memory to a register. Store instruction is used to transfer data from register to memory. Add instruction performs addition operation on two registers. In RISC-V 64, we have 32 registers and their ABI names play a role in maintaining compatibility and facilitating communication between different software components
## Labwork using ABI function calls
c code for adding numbers 1 to 9 named prgm
~~~
#include <stdio.h>

extern int load(int x, int y);

int main(){
	int result = 0;
	int count = 9;
	result = load(0x0,count+1);
	printf("sum of numbers from 1 to 9 is %d \n",result);
}
~~~
the above c code in risc-v instruction set named load.s
~~~
.section .text
.global load
.type load, @function

load:
	add a4,a0,zero //initialize a4 with value 0x0
	add a2,a0,a1   //store value as 10 in a2, a1 has value 0xa from main function
	add a3,a0,zero //initialize a3 with value 0 
loop:   add a4,a3,a4   //incremental addition
	addi a3,a3,1   //increment a3 by 1
	blt a3,a2,loop //if a3 is lesser than a2 then pass through the loop again
	add a0,a4,zero //store final answer in a0
	ret

<summary>iverilog</summary>
1.the rtl design is the implementation of a spec and we check the
functionality by simulating the design in a simulator
2.the simulator we'd be using is iverilog
3.the design is a set of verilog codes that has implemented the spec
like say full adder implemented with a lot of sub-blocks
4.a testbench is the setup  to apply some inputs and check whether 
the design is working as required
5.how does the simulator work it looks for changes in input and responds to them if there is no change in ip no change in op
6.we provide a design file and a testbench corresponding to the design file to iverilog and it generates a vcd file
(value change dump)
7.this vcd file cannot be directly viewwed and we use this other application called gtkwave to view the vcd file


1.running iverilog and gtkwave
~~~
iverilog good_mux.v tb_good_mux.v 
./a.out
gtkwave tb_good_mux.vcd

<summary>yosys</summary>
1. yosys is a tool used to convert rtl to netlist it is called a synthesizer
2. we have a verilog design and have .lib file that contains the standard cells required for synthesis
given this to yosys it can generate a technology specific netlist
3. there is a read_verilog command to read design and read_liberty for the library file
and write_verilog to write out the netlist
4. now for checking whether the netlist generated is accurate we give the netlist and the testbench to iverilog
and we get a vcd file and use gtkwave to see the wave

### class 2
1. what is rtl design it is the  behavioural representation  of the required specs using a hdl

but what we need is a hardware not code ?
the rtl design  is converted into gates and the connection are made between the gates and given out 
in a file called netlist this is done by a logic synthesizer such as yosys

rtl --> synthesis --> netlist

2. what is .lib it is a collection  of logical modules including basic gates etc it may contain modifications of the same gate	
![image](https://github.com/JiteshNayak2004/PD_ASIC/assets/117510555/b3cdbf1f-2186-4571-a49d-d0b08f2b9612)



3. we'd need fast gates cuz we wanna reduce t_comb as that is the only parameter that we can modify and play around with in sequential ckts
as tpcq,tccq etc are fixed values
4. the slow cells are required to address hold time issues
load in digital ckts are capacitance
faster the charging/discharging of capacitance lesser the delay
->to charge/discharge the capacitances faster, we need transistors capable of sourcing more current higher w/l
->wider transistors low delay but more area and power
->narrow transistors high delay but less area and power
5. what kinda cells to use faster slower medium depends on the constraints we set the synthesizer optimizes the best soln
in all parameters according to these constraints

## Timing libs, Hierarchical vs Flat Synthesis and Efficient flop coding styles

<details>
<summary>Timing libs</summary>
	
To view the contents inside the .lib file type the following command :
```
cd ASIC/sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop/lib/
gvim sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
```
One of the fundamental parameter stored within .lib files comprises PVT parameters, where P signifies Process, V represents Voltage, and T denotes Temperature. 
The variations in these parameters can cause significant changes in the performance of circuits.

1. Process Variation: During the manufacturing process, there may be some deviations in the transistor characteristics, causing non-uniformity across the semiconductor wafer. Critical parameters like oxide thickness, dopant concentration, and transistor dimensions experience alterations.

2. Voltage Variation: Voltage regulators might exhibit variability in their output voltage over time, inducing fluctuations in current and impacting the operational speed of circuits. 

3. Temperature Variation: The functionality of a semiconductor device is sensitive to changes in temperature, particularly at the internal junctions of the chip. 

Further it contains the technology that is used is CMOS for which delay are modelled  through table lookup. This file also defines the units for parameters like voltage, power, current, capacitance, and resistance. Within the .lib library, each standard cell consists a  set of parameters specific to that cell's features.

Consider the a2111oi gate whose parameters and verilog files is shown below:

1. here a21110i means and first 2 ips and or it with other inputs
2. Within the .lib file, sevetral parameters specific to this particular standard cell is given, including leakage power values for every possible input combination,specifications regarding pin type and pin capacitances,internal power metrics, timing-related particulars, as well as area measurements and power-related specifics for the standard cells. Similarly for all the standard cells the parameters above mentioned is listed in the .lib file.

Consider the different versions of the same logic gate shown below:


In all the three the logic inferred is same bu the area is different. Wider cells consume more power but delay wise it is less. The leakage power in the wider cell is more compared to the narrow cell which is depicted in the image .

### **Hiererchical Synthesis and Flat Synthesis**
Hierarchical synthesis is breaking a comples modules into smaller, more manageable sub-modules or blocks. Each of these sub-modules can be synthesized or designed independently before being integrated into the larger system. This approach allows for efficient design, optimization, and verification of individual components while maintaining a structured and organized design process. An illustration of the hierarchical synthesis is shown below :

Consider the verilog file multiple module which is given in the verilog_files directory

 ```
module sub_module2 (input a, input b, output y);
	assign y = a | b;
endmodule

module sub_module1 (input a, input b, output y);
	assign y = a&b;
endmodule


module multiple_modules (input a, input b, input c , output y);
	wire net1;
	sub_module1 u1(.a(a),.b(b),.y(net1));  //net1 = a&b
	sub_module2 u2(.a(net1),.b(c),.y(y));  //y = net1|c ,ie y = a&b + c;
endmodule
 ```

 In this case the module multiple_modules iinstantiates two sub_modules where the sub_module1 implements the AND gate and sub_module2 implemets the OR gate which are integrated in the multiple_modules.  Synthesis the multiple module using the sollowing commands:
 ```
 # Remove "#" if needed
 cd /home/kanish/ASIC/sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop/verilog_files
 yosys
 read_liberty -lib ../lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib 
 read_verilog 
 read_verilog multiple_modules.v 
 synth -top multiple_modules
 abc -liberty ../lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib 
 show multiple_modules
 write_verilog multiple_modules_hier.v
 ``` 
 ___
 **Note:**</br>
 When using hierarchical design instead of enetering the ***show*** command to view the file ***show <module_name>*** must be otherwise yosys will generate the following error : "ERROR: For formats different than 'ps' or 'dot' only one module must be selected."
 ___

 ![hier_show](./images/week_2_day_2/hierarchi_des.png)
 ![netlist_hier](./images/week_2_day_2/netlist_hier.png)
 
 Yosys does not show the AND gate and OR gate in the synthesis instead it shows the submodule names. The netlist also contains the AND and OR logic in separate submodules. Some times yosys may optimize the design such that the OR gate will be created using NAND gates. It is because the CMOS structure of the OR gate which is shown below has two pmos transistors stacked together. The mobility of the holes is less than the mobility of the electrons , since mosfets are majority carrier devices and majority carrier of the pmos is holes it increases the delay hence it becomes a bad circuit. In NAND gate implementation only the nmos are stacked.
 ![cmos_or](./images/week_2_day_2/CMOS_OR.jpg)

Flattening the hierarchy means simplifying the hierarchical structure of a design by collapsing or merging lower-level modules or blocks into a single, unified representation. In yosys the flattening can be done with ***flat*** command. Yosys illustration of flattening the hiererchy.

```
 cd /home/kanish/ASIC/sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop/verilog_files
 yosys
 read_liberty -lib ../lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib 
 read_verilog 
 read_verilog multiple_modules.v 
 synth -top multiple_modules
 abc -liberty ../lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib 
 flatten
 show
 write_verilog multiple_modules_flat.v
```
![flat_des](./images/week_2_day_2/flat_des.png)
![netlist_flat](./images/week_2_day_2/netlist_flat.png)

The flatten command breaks the hierarchy and makes the design into a single module by creating AND and OR gates for the logics inferred by the submodule which is shown in the images above.

### **Synthesising a Submodule :**
Suppose a multiplier design needs to be used in numerous instances. Rather than undergoing synthesis six times independently, the preferred approach is to synthesize it once and then duplicate it within the primary module. Using module-level synthesis becomes advantageous when dealing with multiple occurrences of identical modules. Another reason for synthesizing submodule is to follow the principle of divide and conque for extensive designs that may not be optimized effectively, synthesizing the design module by module ensures that each module is effectively optimized.

**Steps to synthesis submodule :**

```
cd /home/kanish/ASIC/sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop/verilog_files
yosys
read_liberty -lib ../lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib 
read_verilog multiple_modules.v 
synth -top sub_module
abc -liberty ../lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib 
show
```
